<!-- Extra Practice

Using setInterval and setTimeout, write some JavaScript that will log a message to the console every 3/4 of a second (ie every 750 milliseconds), and stop logging messages after 5 seconds.

Using JavaScript:

change the text of an element with the id of change-my-text to 'hello, codeup!'
change the font color of all elements with the class change-my-color to salmon
add the class my-paragraph to all <p> tags
Bonus: do this without removing any classes that are already present
change the padding-top CSS property of the <body> to 40px -->
